        <p style="color:white">Psychologist and co-founder building science‑based tools for everyday well-being.</p>
        <p style="color:white">I'm a co-founder of Flourish Science, where I help translate behavioral research into practical tools for everyday well-being. At Flourish, I develop science-based content and lead large-scale, multi-institutional randomized controlled trials testing the impact of digital well-being interventions in real-world settings.</p>
        <p style="color:white">I earned my PhD in affective science at Stanford University, where my research focused on emotion, culture, and close relationships. I'm especially interested in what people want to feel in life, the kinds of relationships they hope to build, and how cultural context shapes these preferences.</p>
        <p style="color:white">Before Stanford, I earned my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in psychology at New York University, where I studied motivation and communication in romantic relationships.</p>
        <p style="color:white">Alongside my academic and applied work, I have over a decade of experience in meditation and yoga and find deep meaning in exploring the mind–body connection. I'm a certified yoga instructor through YogaX at Stanford Psychiatry and regularly guide evidence-informed practices, including guided imagery and meditations.</p>
