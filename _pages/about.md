I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in the [Culture and Emotion Lab](https://culture-emotion-lab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I'm passionate about empowering people to cultivate their own and others’ well-being using evidence-based tools. In my research, I'm fascinated by what people ideally want in life, including what emotions they want to feel, the kinds of close relationships they want to have, and how their environment and cultural context shape the development of these preferences. 

Before that, I received my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees at New York University, where I conducted research on motivation and communication among romantic partners in the [Motivation Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/motivationlab/).
